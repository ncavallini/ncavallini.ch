## Overview

Built as my Bachelor's thesis at ETH Zurich (Grade: **5.75 / 6.00**), this project is an interactive visual debugging tool enabling domain experts to inspect and correct ML-based extraction of structured data from free trade agreement PDFs.

## What it does

The tool processes free trade agreement documents and extracts structured data such as rules of origin and tariff concessions. Domain experts can then visually inspect the extraction results and provide corrections through an intuitive UI, creating an iterative feedback loop that improves accuracy.
